A Moment of Self-Realization: Declined

The movie, "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is one of my all time favorite movies. The best scene in the movie is when Ferris, Sloane, and Cameron go to the Institute of Art in Chicago to admire the art. One part in particular that has always stood out to me is the scene with the intense eye contact between Cameron and the painting, A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte by Georges Seurat. I personally believe that this the moment when Cameron realizes that he wants to change the way his life is. As I thought about this scene, I thought about how many people go to art museums just to be on their phone the entire time. If Cameron had a smartphone in the 80s, he may have missed this moment of self-reflection which is what I created this image. As Ferris Bueller says in the movie, "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."
